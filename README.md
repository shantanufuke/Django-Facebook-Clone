Project Overview:
Hey everyone! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my Facebook Clone project! Itâ€™s been a challenging yet rewarding journey, and Iâ€™ve gained a lot of experience working with Django and WebSockets to create a social networking platform. ðŸ˜…

Initially, I was focusing on building a basic social network, but the project evolved to include features like real-time updates for posts, comments, and likes. I also added a friend request system and notifications to make it feel like a fully interactive social platform.

Key Features:
User Authentication: Secure registration, login, and user session management.
Real-Time Updates: Posts, comments, and likes update instantly without page reloads using AJAX.
Friend Requests and Notifications: Send friend requests, accept/reject them, and get notified in real-time.
Real-Time Chat: WebSockets enable instant messaging between users.
Responsive Design: Fully compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
