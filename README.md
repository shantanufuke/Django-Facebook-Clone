### **Project Overview:**
Hey everyone! ðŸŽ‰ Iâ€™m excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my **Facebook Clone** project! Itâ€™s been a challenging yet rewarding journey, and Iâ€™ve gained a lot of experience working with Django and WebSockets to create a social networking platform. ðŸ˜…

Initially, I was focusing on building a basic social network, but the project evolved to include features like real-time updates for posts, comments, and likes. I also added a friend request system and notifications to make it feel like a fully interactive social platform.

### **Key Features:**
- **User Authentication**: Secure registration, login, and user session management.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Posts, comments, and likes update instantly without page reloads using AJAX.
- **Friend Requests and Notifications**: Send friend requests, accept/reject them, and get notified in real-time.
- **Real-Time Chat**: WebSockets enable instant messaging between users.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully compatible with desktop and mobile devices.
